Welcome to my Neural Network Exploration Portfolio! As a passionate Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Full Sail University, I am thrilled to embark on the intriguing journey of neural networks and share my experiences.

This portfolio is a living showcase of various neural network architectures I have explored, each hosted in its dedicated repository. As I continue to work on projects, this portfolio will be updated to reflect my evolving understanding and application of neural network principles.

Highlighted Projects:

    Titanic Survivors Analysis: Utilized machine learning algorithms to analyze the survival rates of Titanic passengers, showcasing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and validation.
