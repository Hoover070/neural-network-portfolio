Welcome to my Neural Network Exploration Portfolio! As a passionate Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Full Sail University, I am thrilled to delve into the realm of neural networks and share my explorations.

This portfolio is a curated collection of various neural network architectures I have implemented, each within its dedicated repository. Ranging from basic models like Perceptrons to advanced architectures like Generative Adversarial Networks, this portfolio reflects my continuous journey in understanding and applying neural network principles.

Repositories Overview:

    Basic Neural Networks: A dive into foundational neural network models including Perceptrons and Multi-layer Perceptrons.
    Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Exploring image recognition and analysis with CNNs.
    Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Delving into sequence data processing with various RNN architectures.
    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Generating new data that mimics a given dataset using GANs.
    Transformer Networks: Investigating natural language processing tasks using Transformer architectures.
    ... and more!

Each repository contains a detailed README, explaining the architecture, its applications, the implementation process, and results obtained. Additionally, you'll find comments throughout the code providing further insight into the logic and techniques employed.

Technologies Used:

    Python
    TensorFlow
    PyTorch
    Keras
    ... and other AI/ML libraries and tools.
