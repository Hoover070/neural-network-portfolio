Welcome to my Neural Network Exploration Portfolio! As a passionate Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Full Sail University, I am thrilled to delve into the realm of neural networks and share my explorations.

This portfolio is a curated collection of various neural network architectures I have implemented, each within its dedicated repository. Ranging from basic models like Perceptrons to advanced architectures like Generative Adversarial Networks, this portfolio reflects my continuous journey in understanding and applying neural network principles.

Repositories Overview:

  [Basic Neural Network](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamhoover70/): A dive into foundational neural network models including Perceptrons and Multi-layer Perceptrons.
